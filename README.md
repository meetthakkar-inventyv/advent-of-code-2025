# Advent of Code Solutions

This repository contains my personal solutions for [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/). 

Advent of Code is an annual series of Christmas-themed computer programming challenges that follow an Advent calendar. These solutions are implemented in C++.

## Project Structure

The project is organized by day, with each folder containing the source code for that specific challenge.

* **day1/** to **day5/**: Contains the C++ source files (e.g., `part1.cpp`, `part2.cpp`).
* **Language**: C++
* **Environment**: VS Code / Windows PowerShell

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To compile and run these solutions, you need a C++ compiler (such as GCC/MinGW) installed on your system.

### Compilation

Navigate to the specific day's directory and compile using a C++ compiler:

```bash
g++ part1.cpp -o part1
